**Chatify** is a full-stack, real-time chat application featuring direct messaging, contact management, and one-to-one video calling powered by WebRTC and Socket.IO.

The project is split into two main components: a feature-rich **React/Vite frontend** and a **secure Node.js/Express backend**.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-Time Messaging:** Instantaneous message delivery using Socket.IO.
* **One-to-One Video Calling (WebRTC):** Secure, peer-to-peer video calls using simple-peer for signaling.
* **Authentication:** Secure JWT-based authentication with cookie persistence across domains (Vercel/Render friendly).
* **User Management:** Sign up, log in, view online users, and update profile pictures.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment Guide

This application uses a hybrid deployment model essential for WebSocket functionality.

### 1. Backend Deployment (Render)

* Deploy the backend repository to Render as a **Web Service**.
* Ensure the start command is set to `npm start` (or `node src/index.js`).
* Retrieve the final public API URL (e.g., `https://chatify-3qre.onrender.com`).

### 2. Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

* Deploy the frontend repository to Vercel.
* In Vercel Project Settings, set the **Root Directory** to `frontend/`.
* Set this critical environment variable in Vercel:

```
Key: VITE_API_URL
Value: https://chatify-3qre.onrender.com
```

* **CORS & Cookie Fixes:**

  * Backend JWT cookie: `sameSite: 'None'` and `secure: true` in production.
  * Backend CORS: Include your Vercel domain (`https://ping-it-up.vercel.app`) in the origin list.
